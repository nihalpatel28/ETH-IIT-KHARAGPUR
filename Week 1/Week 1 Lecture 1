## 1. What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical Hacking** is the **authorized and legal practice** of identifying weaknesses and vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or applications by **thinking and acting like a malicious hacker**, but with permission.

### Key Idea
- Ethical hackers **replicate the intent and actions** of malicious hackers
- Goal is **security improvement**, not damage

### Definition (Easy to Remember)
> Ethical hacking is the act of **legally breaking into systems** to find security weaknesses before attackers do.

### Also Known As
- Penetration Testing
- Intrusion Testing
- Red Teaming

### ASCII Concept Diagram
```
Malicious Hacker           Ethical Hacker
----------------           ----------------
Breaks security            Tests security
No permission              Written permission
Causes damage              Reports weaknesses
Steals data                Protects data
```

## 2. Ethical Hacking vs Penetration Testing vs Security Testing

### Ethical Hacking
- Broad term
- Used by companies to improve security
- Covers tools, techniques, and mindset

### Penetration Testing
- **Legal attempt** to break into a company’s network
- Objective: **find weak links**
- Testers **only report findings**
- ❌ Do NOT fix problems

### Security Testing
- Includes **security policies & procedures**
- Testers may **suggest solutions**
- More defensive in nature

### Comparison Table
```
Ethical Hacking → Think like attacker
Pen Testing     → Find vulnerabilities
Security Test   → Secure & protect system
```

## 3. Important Terminologies

### 3.1 Hacking
- Using computer expertise to **bypass or explore systems**
- Can be legal or illegal depending on permission

### 3.2 Cracking
- **Illegal activity**
- Breaking security of software or systems

### 3.3 Spoofing
- Faking identity (IP address, email, MAC address)
- Example: pretending to be a trusted system

### 3.4 Denial of Service (DoS)
- Flooding a target with excessive traffic
- Makes system **unavailable to users**

#### ASCII Flow
```
Attacker
   |
   |  Massive Requests
   v
[ Server ]  ❌ Cannot Respond
```

### 3.5 Port Scanning
- Searching for **open ports**
- Ports = entry points
- Each running service listens on a port

```
PC / Server
-----------
Port 21  → FTP
Port 22  → SSH
Port 80  → HTTP
Port 443 → HTTPS

Open Port = Possible Entry
```

## 4. Gaining Access

### 4.1 Front Door Attacks

Methods:
- Password guessing
- Guessing valid passwords
- Password / key stealing

```
[ Login Page ]
Username: admin
Password: ??????
```

### 4.2 Back Door

- Hidden entry points
- Left intentionally or accidentally by developers
- Often used for debugging

Examples:
- Default router passwords
- Hidden admin accounts

### 4.3 Trojan Horses

- Malicious software hidden inside legit software
- Installed unknowingly by users

```
User downloads free software
        ↓
Trojan installs backdoor
        ↓
Hacker gains access
```

### 4.4 Software Vulnerability Exploitation

- Vulnerabilities are often published by vendors
- Fixed using **security patches**
- Hackers exploit **unpatched systems**

> Script kiddies often use ready-made tools to exploit known vulnerabilities

---

## 5. Once Inside the System, Hackers Can

### 5.1 Modify Logs
- Logs track system activity
- Hackers delete or alter logs to **hide traces**

### 5.2 Steal Files
- Data theft
- Sometimes destroy data after stealing

### 5.3 Modify Files
- To show presence
- To cause mischief

### 5.4 Install Backdoors
- Most dangerous
- Allows attacker to return anytime
- User may never know

```
Initial Attack → Backdoor Installed → Re-entry Anytime
```

## 6. Role of Security & Penetration Testers

### Script Kiddies / Packet Monkeys
- Inexperienced hackers
- Use copied tools and scripts
- Limited understanding

### Professional Penetration Testers
- Write custom tools and scripts
- Programming languages used:
  - Perl
  - C / C++
  - Python
  - JavaScript

---

## 7. Penetration Testing Methodologies

### 7.1 Tiger Box
- Laptop with:
  - Multiple Operating Systems
  - Hacking tools
- Used for:
  - Vulnerability assessment
  - Attacks simulation

### 7.2 White Box Model
- Tester knows everything
- Network topology known
- Interview company IT staff

```
[ Company ] → Full Info → Tester
```

### 7.3 Black Box Model
- Tester knows nothing
- Same as real attacker
- Tester must discover everything

```
[ Company ] ← No Info → Tester
```

### 7.4 Grey Box Model
- Hybrid approach
- Partial information provided

```
White Box + Black Box = Grey Box
```

---

## 8. What You Can Legally Do

- Technology laws change rapidly
- Laws differ from place to place
- Always know **local cyber laws**

### Illegal Activities
- Accessing a computer without permission
- Installing viruses or worms
- DoS attacks
- Denying users access to network resources

> Even possessing some tools may be illegal in certain regions

---

## 9. Ethical Hacking in a Nutshell

### To Become a Security Tester, You Need:

- Knowledge of:
  - Networking
  - Computer systems
- Communication skills
  - Management
  - IT personnel
- Understanding of laws
- Ability to use necessary tools
