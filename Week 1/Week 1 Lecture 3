## 1. Datagram Approach

* No route is established beforehand
* No initial setup delay
* Each packet is transmitted **independently**
* No fixed path for data transmission
* Network does **not maintain history** of packets

### Example

* Postal system (letters may take different routes)

```
A → B → C
A → D → C
(Packets may follow different paths)
```

---

## 2. Routing in Datagram Networks

* Each intermediate node makes **dynamic routing decisions**
* Routing table is used at every node
* Each packet contains:

  * Source address
  * Destination address

If destination address is incorrect, the packet is dropped.

---

## 3. Problems in Datagram Networks

* Packets may arrive **out of order**
* Some packets may take longer routes
* Packet loss if node crashes (buffer overflow)
* Duplicate packets may be generated

  * Happens when ACK is delayed or not received

---

## 4. Advantages of Datagram Approach

* Faster for small packet sizes
* No route establishment or termination delay
* More flexible
* Can dynamically switch paths if nodes are overloaded
* Packets between two hosts may follow different paths

---

## 5. Network Delays (Comparative Study)

Three types of delays must be considered:

### (a) Propagation Delay

* Time taken by a signal to travel from source to destination
* Depends on distance and medium

### (b) Transmission Delay

* Time taken to transmit a packet
* Depends on bandwidth (Mbps)

### (c) Processing Delay

* Time taken by a node to process a packet
* Occurs in store‑and‑forward method

---

## 6. Circuit vs Virtual Circuit Packet Switching

### Circuit Switching

* After circuit establishment, data flows continuously
* No delay during transmission

### Virtual Circuit Packet Switching

* Call request sent first
* Call accept received back
* Packets sent sequentially in pipelined manner
* Uses store‑and‑forward technique

---

## 7. Datagram Packet Switching

* No initial delay
* Small data reaches faster
* Data sent independently
* Packets may follow different paths
* Highly flexible
* Most widely used
* Uses store‑and‑forward method

---

## 8. Layered Network Architecture

* Networking system has many responsibilities
* Dividing tasks into layers simplifies design
* Each layer has a **well‑defined responsibility**

### OSI Reference Model

* Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
* 7‑layer hierarchical model
* Changes in one layer do not affect others

---

## 9. The 7‑Layer OSI Model

```
7. Application
6. Presentation
5. Session
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data Link
1. Physical
```

### Visibility

* Upper layers (Application → Transport): Host‑to‑Host
* Lower layers (Network → Physical): Node‑to‑Node

---

## 10. Functions of OSI Layers

### Physical Layer

* Deals with electrical/optical signals
* Transmits raw bit stream

### Data Link Layer

* Reliable transfer of frames
* Flow control and error control
* Retransmits data if error occurs

### Network Layer

* Packet routing and forwarding
* Establishing, maintaining, terminating connections

### Transport Layer

* End‑to‑end reliable data transfer
* Error recovery and flow control

### Session Layer

* Manages sessions
* Handles login, logout, session termination

### Presentation Layer

* Optional layer
* Encryption, decryption, formatting

### Application Layer

* Interface between user application and network

---

## 11. How Data Flows (OSI Model)

## 12. Internetworking Devices

### Hub

* Extends LAN

### Bridge / Layer‑2 Switch

* Connects two or more LANs
* Works at Data Link layer

### Router / Layer‑3 Switch

* Connects LANs and WANs
* Works at Network layer
