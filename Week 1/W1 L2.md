## Lecture 02: Basics Concepts of Networking

> These notes are simplified for **easy revision and teaching**. Content is strictly based on the Lecture‑02 handwritten notes.

## 1. Networking Basics

### Computer Network
A **computer network** is a communication system used to connect computers (hosts) so that they can share data and resources.

### Why Networking is Needed
- Better connectivity
- Better communication
- Better sharing of resources (e.g., cloud services like AWS)
- Brings people together

---

## 2. Types of Computer Networks

### 2.1 Local Area Network (LAN)
- Covers a **small geographical area**
- Examples:
  - Same room
  - Same building
  - Same campus

```
[PC] ── [PC] ── [PC]
      (LAN)
```

### 2.2 Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Covers a **large geographical area**
- Hosts are widely dispersed
- Examples:
  - Across campuses
  - Across cities
  - Across countries or continents

```
City A ─── City B ─── Country C
        (WAN)
```

## 3. Data Communication Over a Network

There are **two main approaches** for data communication:

1. Circuit Switching
2. Packet Switching

If there is no direct path between sender and receiver, data is sent through **intermediate nodes** called **routers**.

```
A → B → D → F → H
```

---

## 4. Circuit Switching

### Definition
A **dedicated communication path** is established between two stations before data transmission begins.

### Key Characteristics
- Fixed sequence of intermediate nodes
- Logical channel reserved on each physical link
- Private lane created for communication

```
A ===== B ===== D ===== F ===== H
(Reserved Path)
```

### Steps in Circuit Switching

1. **Connection Establishment**  
   - Required before data transmission

2. **Data Transfer**  
   - Data transfer occurs at maximum speed

3. **Connection Termination**  
   - Resources are released after transmission

---

### Drawbacks of Circuit Switching

- Channel capacity is dedicated for entire duration
- Efficient for voice communication
- Inefficient for bursty data traffic
- Initial delay due to connection setup

---

## 5. Packet Switching

### Definition
A modern method of data communication where **network resources are shared** and data is broken into packets.

### Key Features
- No dedicated path
- Links are shared
- Data divided into packets

```
Message
  ↓
[H|Data] [H|Data] [H|Data]
   Packet  Packet  Packet
```

### Packet Structure
- **Header**: destination, control information
- **Data**: actual content

Each packet is transmitted **independently**.

---

## 6. Store-and-Forward Concept

Packet switching works on the **store-and-forward** principle:

- Each intermediate node:
  - Receives the complete packet
  - Stores it in buffer (memory)
  - Decides next route
  - Forwards the packet

```
Receive → Store → Decide → Forward
```

Each router maintains a **routing table**.

---

## 7. Advantages of Packet Switching

- Better link utilization
- Suitable for computer‑generated bursty traffic
- Buffering allows speed mismatch handling
- Priority can be given to packets

---

## 8. How Packets Are Transmitted

Two approaches:

1. Virtual Circuit
2. Datagram (most commonly used today)

---

## 9. Virtual Circuit Approach

### Concept
- Similar to circuit switching
- Route is established **before packet transmission**

### Key Points
- All packets follow the same route
- Each packet carries a **Virtual Circuit (VC) number**
- No dynamic routing at intermediate nodes

```
Route Established → Packets Follow Same Path
```

### Working Steps

1. Route is established first
2. Packets forwarded using store‑and‑forward
3. Only VC number is carried in packets
4. Intermediate nodes use routing table created during setup

### Example
- Telephone system
